<!-- Excerpt Start -->Humans have only been reading and writing for the last 5000 years or so.<!-- Excerpt End --> But we've been here for over 200,000. Our brains, evolved during those pre-literate years, have really only had a speck of time to deal with our post-literacy information overload.

Genetically we excelled at living in small groups, using verbal communication, curiosity and empathy. We are not ready for this new world of large remote social groups, visual torrents, rote learning and individuality.

Our old genes, barely ready for literacy, need to catch up fast. Or we should just stick to what we are good at?
