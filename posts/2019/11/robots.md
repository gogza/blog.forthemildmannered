<!-- Excerpt Start -->
Robots are no longer science fiction. They are here now and working your jobs.
<!-- Excerpt End -->

They don't need water, food, sleep or oxygen. They don't take breaks when they are thirsty, hungry, or tired. And they don't care if our air is polluted or not. Best of all they don't take such a large slice of a company's profit. All that money can go to their owners instead of any workers.

Once the world has been sucked dry and the air made unbreathable, robots will continue to work hard. And their owners can afford to make their own air and water.
